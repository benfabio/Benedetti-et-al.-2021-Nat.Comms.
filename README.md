This repository contains parts of the R scripts developed during my postdoc at ETH Zürich, D-USYS, IBP, UP group.

The present R scripts were developed to produce the results of the manuscript submitted to Nature Communications (#NCOMMS-20-37764A).

- Scripts labelled as 'RSCRIPTBATCH' are those that were run on a local cluster to perform those functions defined within the script in parallel using the 'parallel' R package (R Core Team, 2020) within a mclapply().
- Scripts that were given a number correspond to those R scripts were I formated and mined the main datasets involved. They usually contain organized sequences of code where data are being read, examined, reformatted, analyzed and plotted.
- "OVERSEE" just corresponds to name I gave to the project overarching my main research activities at ETH Zürich (modelling and forecast of global plankton biodiversity). Therefore, other repositories corresponding to other studies/manuscripts also fall within the 'OVERSEE' umbrella.
- The end of the scripts' names usually indicate their purposes. A more detailed list of the scripts' goals and content is usually given in the beginning of the scripts.
